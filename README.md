# Data Science Projects
## Twitter Sentiment Analysis
This is a project to analyze Twitter sentiments based on real-world tweets.The data has been taken from 'Tweet Sentiment Extraction' -a Kaggle competition 'https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tweet-sentiment-extraction'.
This project focusses on the use of pre-processing tweets to clean the data and also vectorizing using pre-trained word embeddings.
Finally a Bi-directional LSTM model has been used to model and predict the sentiments using raw text.

## Population Change Estimate
This is a project to predict the decadal growth rate of various countries  based on  various population indicators of previous years.
This project involves extensive data preparation and cleaning to organize the data which then has been used to train a SequentialLinear Regression model to predict the future population growth.

## Predictive Maintainance Milling Machine
This is a project to predict the failures in milling machine taken from a  Kaggle dataset-'https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanmatzka/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020'
Since the failures were rare , the dataset was balanced using oversampling techniques from Imbalanced-learn package.The model utilized Tree-based Ensemble Boosting techniques to make the prediction for each type of failure.
